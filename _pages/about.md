I am an associate professor of [Decision Analytics and Operations](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/zhanksun/) in the College of Business, City University of Hong Kong. I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University) in 2009, and Ph.D. in Statistics and Operations Research from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill) in 2014<a href="/files/PhD-Degree.pdf" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;">.</a> I was an Eyes High scholar in the Haskayne School of Business from 2014 to 2016, during which I work closely with [Alberta Health Services](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/) and emergency departments in Alberta, Canada.

My research interests are within the area of modeling, analysis, and control of stochastic systems. I am particularly interested in applications that arise from healthcare operations, such as patient flow management in hospital emergency departments and emergency response management in the aftermath of mass-casualty events. I am also exploring applications in smart-city operations. I received the [College Research Excellence Awards](https://zhanksun.github.io/) in 2023.
