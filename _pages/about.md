I am a primary 5 student at [Kowloon Tong School](https://www.ktsps.edu.hk/eng/index.html) (Primary Section) in Hong Kong. I was born in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. I am a big fan of sports, including badminton, track and field, and rope skipping. I love reading. My favourite book is Matilda by [Roald Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl).
