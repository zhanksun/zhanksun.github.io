I am an Assistant Professor of [Management Sciences](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/staff/zhanksun/) in the College of Business[,](https://www.cb.cityu.edu.hk/) City University of Hong Kong.

I received my bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from [Tsinghua University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsinghua_University) in 2009, and Ph.D. in Statistics and Operations Research from [UNC Chapel Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill) in 2014[.](/files/Degree_PHD.pdf) I was an Eyes High scholar in the Haskayne School of Business, University of Calgary, Canada from 2014 to 2016, during which I work closely with [Alberta Health Services](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/) and emergency departments in Alberta, Canada.

My research interests are within the area of modeling, analysis, and control of stochastic systems. I am particularly interested in applications that arise from healthcare operations, such as emergency response management in the aftermath of mass-casualty events and patient flow management in hospital emergency departments. I am also interested and exploring applications in the filed of smart city operations.

I am recruting motivated PhD students now. Feel free to contact me if you are interested.
