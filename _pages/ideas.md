## Ongoing

1. FT routing paper: writing, new simulation, conclusion **submit by early January 2021**
2. FT routing modeling paper: proof of results; try different patient classifications and compare their performances (by admit, LOS, chance of FT)
3. Two small papers
4. Medical paper: the impact of ED census on ED decision making

## Next step
1. ED patient prioritization
    1. Choice model: waiting for room (patient chosen by nurses)
    1. Choice model: initial assessment (patient chosen by physicians)
    1. Non-aligned objectives might lead to inefficiency
2. ED double bottlenecks: Bed + Physicians
    2. Stochastic modeling (SOQN, Jia and Heragu 2009, Operations Research)
    2. Fluid model (MMFQ, Carmen et al. 2018, EJOR)
    2. Perturbation analysis
    2. So-what: ED surging plan
3. ED specialist: stochastic clearing system [PDF](/files/He-StochasticClearingSystem.pdf)
4. Data from Cathy Pacific: optimize then predict
5. Clear energy
