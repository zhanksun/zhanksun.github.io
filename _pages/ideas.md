## Researchers of interest
* Prof. Nan Liu [(website)](https://sites.google.com/site/nanliuacademic/research)
* Prof. Armann Ingolfsson [(website)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=o--KHAQAAAAJ)
* Prof. Serhan Ziya [(website)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=EFUfwAMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)
* Prof. Lawrence M. Wein [(website)](https://lwein.people.stanford.edu/published-papers-and-technical-reports): a series of works on manufacturing by Prof. David Yao, John Buzacott
* Prof. Lei Ying [(website)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7f3HKI8AAAAJ&hl=en)

## Small papers

* Queueing paper: value of information
* Cheng's paper editing
* OR Letter paper editing
* EJOR paper editing
* Chinook paper

## Ongoing

1. FT routing paper: writing, new simulation, conclusion (Target: **Management Sciecne**)
2. FT routing modeling paper: proof of results; try different patient classifications and compare their performances (by admit, LOS, chance of FT) (Target: with the redundancy modeling, we can try **Operations Research**)
    * **Perhaps we can consider a shadow patient**, with a focus on CTAS3, or patients in the middle. Refer to two papers in Notability. This could be a nice queueing analysis.
4. Medical paper: the impact of ED census on ED decision making (consider different measures of blocking, such as boarding time of the previous $n$ patients) (Target: **Medical journal**)
5. ED staffing with PPH: waiting time estimation; modeling the time-varying PPH (Target: **Operations Research**)
7. ED patient prioritization (Target: **Management Sciecne**)
    1. Choice model: waiting for room (patient chosen by nurses)
    1. Choice model: initial assessment (patient chosen by physicians)
    1. Non-aligned objectives might lead to inefficiency
6. Waiting time prediction with patient prioritization (Target: perhanps **MSOM**)

## Next step
1. ED double bottlenecks: Bed + Physicians
    1. Stochastic modeling (SOQN, Jia and Heragu 2009, Operations Research)
    1. Fluid model (MMFQ, Carmen et al. 2018, EJOR)
    1. Perturbation analysis
    1. So-what: ED surging plan
3. ED specialist: stochastic clearing system [\[PDF\]](/files/He-StochasticClearingSystem.pdf)
4. With Lishuai:
    * Drone delivery
    * Data from Cathy Pacific: optimize then predict
